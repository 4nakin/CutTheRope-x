A CutTheRope like game demo made with cocos2d-x 2.1.3.

This game is portable and it can run both on ios and android.

If you want to run it on android device, you should do some little configs.

TODO:
1.Due to the like of cross-platform guesture regonizer, so I don't implement
a "long press" guesture. I use two tap count for the long press event.
