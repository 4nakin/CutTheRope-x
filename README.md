A CutTheRope like game demo made with cocos2d-x 2.1.3.

This game is portable and it can run both on ios and android.

If you want to run it on android device, you can copy directory "android"
to your cocos2dx root directory, then you can run it on your android device.


TODO:

    1.Due to the like of cross-platform guesture regonizer, so I don't implement a "long press" guesture. I use two tap count for the long press event.
