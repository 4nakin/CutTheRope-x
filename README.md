A CutTheRope like game demo with a in-game level editor,  made with cocos2d-x 2.1.3.

The game is portable and it can run both on ios and android.

If you want to run it on android device, you should copy directory "android"
to your cocos2dx root directory, then you can run it on your android device.


TODO:

    1.Due to the lack of a cross-platform guesture regonizer, so I don't implement a "long press" guesture. I use two tap count for the long press event.If you can confuse about this, you should read the follows tutorials first.
